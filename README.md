## **Overview**

Welcome to the third chapter of my journey into the React ecosystem! ðŸš€ Click [here](#projects) to jump to the project list.

In my [first repository](https://github.com/Neonsy/React-First-Steps), I dove into the basics of React, exploring it's vanilla form.
Then, in the [second repository](https://github.com/Neonsy/NextJS-Server-Steps), I ventured into the world of Next.js, discovering it's powerful features.

I initially planned to work on my [personal portfolio site](https://github.com/Neonsy/NextJS-Portfolio), but I've decided to put that on hold and take time to gather more knowledge.
That project has already been a rollercoaster, having been rebuilt three times due to CI/CD workflow adjustments, because I was lacking local testing capabilities.
You can read more about this journey [here](https://github.com/Neonsy/NextJS-Portfolio/pull/1).
> [!NOTE]
> It may have been a lot of work to get it done right, and a bit stressful, but pushing and learning beyond the current state of knowledge, is an exhilarating experience.

Now, it's time to tackle state management, to put focus on it!
While `useState`, `useContext`, and `useReducer` are great tools in vanilla React, they can become cumbersome for more complex applications, or even just mid sized ones.

## **Goals**

This repository has two main objectives:

1. **Master State Management**: I aim to gain a deeper understanding of state management techniques.
2. **Working with Zustand and Jotai**: I'm excited to get practical experience with **[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)** and **[Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai)**.

Although Redux is a well-known option, it's verbosity makes it less appealing for smaller projects.
Instead, I'll be using Zustand for it's simplicity and Jotai for it's atomic state management capabilities.

> [!NOTE]
> Yes, I know that next to Jotai is [Recoil](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/Recoil), developed by Facebook.

## **Approach**

I'm going to create a series of small projects utilizing these packages.
Unlike my earlier **`React First Steps`**, I'll incorporate TypeScript to enhance my coding skills.

Since this project focuses on React, I'll use Vite instead of Next.js, allowing me to experiment with [TanStack/ReactRouter](https://github.com/TanStack/router).

To simulate remote data interactions, I'll likely use JSON-Server and leverage [TanStack/ReactQuery](https://github.com/TanStack/query) for efficient data fetching.
