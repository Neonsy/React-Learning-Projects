# ShopCompare

Welcome to **ShopCompare**, a personal learning project designed to explore and experiment with various technologies in the React ecosystem.
This project leverages TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, Jotai, and Zustand to create a shopping comparison application.

## Project Overview

**ShopCompare** is part of my personal learning repository where I delve into state management and other tools to enhance my understanding of modern web development practices.
The goal is to integrate these technologies seamlessly with React to build an interactive and responsive user interface.

> [!NOTE]
> This is also my first React project and I am excited to continue learning TypeScript and React.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better code quality.
- **React**: The core library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that enhances development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
- **TanStack Router**: For managing application routes.
- **TanStack Query**: For data fetching and caching.
- **Jotai & Zustand**: For state management solutions.

## Thoughts Behind the Component Directory Structure

When organizing components, there are two approaches I've considered:

1. **Single File Approach**: A component and its sub-components reside within the same file.
   This can be beneficial for smaller components or when sub-components are not reused elsewhere.
2. **Multi-File Approach**: Components with sub-components are placed in separate files, with the main component exported in an `index` file.
   This approach promotes better organization and scalability.

While I'm still exploring which method might be "preferred" or "more optimal," I currently lean towards the second option for its clarity and maintainability.
Exporting components individually does not detract from organization thanks to a well-structured folder system.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to:

- Gain hands-on experience with TypeScript and React.
- Understand the nuances of modern state management libraries like Jotai and Zustand.
- Explore advanced routing and data fetching techniques with TanStack Router and Query.
- Enhance styling skills using Tailwind CSS in a React environment.

Feel free to explore the codebase and provide feedback or suggestions as I continue on this learning journey!
